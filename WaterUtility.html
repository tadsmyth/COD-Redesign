<p><font color="#800000"><strong>NOTES</strong></font>: (related to the illustration shown 
above)<br>


<p>City of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) is a not-for-profit department of the City of Dallas providing water and wastewater services to about 2.4 million people in Dallas and 27 nearby communities. Its operations are funded solely by the water and wastewater rates paid by customers.  Customers’ water use is metered to ensure accurate billing.</p>

<p><strong>Water Utilities Functions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Business and Customer Operations</strong> provides accounting, financial, and budget support to the Water Utilities Department; and provides customer relations, billings, credit and collections activities, customer information, and all meter-associated services to the water, wastewater and stormwater utility customers. In addition, this program provides for the management of wholesale water and wastewater services to other governmental entities within the utility's service area.</p>

<p><strong>Water Operations</strong> is responsible for operating and maintaining the facilities of the Water Utilities Department.  These activities include the raw water impoundment and watershed management, and the purification, pumping and distribution of potable water.</p>

<p><strong>Wastewater Operations</strong> is responsible for collecting, transporting, controlling the discharge of, and treating domestic and industrial wastes; and for maintaining treatment plants and pipelines in the wastewater system.</p>

<p><strong>Capital Improvement Operations</strong> plans, designs, constructs and inspects the capital projects needed to provide customers with water, wastewater, and stormwater facilities to meet the growth of the community, extension of water, wastewater mains, and stormwater modification of facilities to meet changes in State and Federal regulatory requirements (Environmental Protection Agency Administrative Orders, Safe Drinking Water Act treatment parameters and Clean Water Act discharge limitations), and the rehabilitation and replacement of deteriorated or obsolete facilities. </p>

<p><strong>General Expense and Debt Service</strong> provides overall financial support to the Department in areas where the expenditures are not directly tied to the day to day operational and overhead aspects of the department.  All such expenditures require special monitoring and control.  Key items within General Expense and Debt Service include street rental, transfer to the construction funds, general fund cost reimbursement and debt service commitments.</p>


<p><strong>Floodplain & Drainage Management</strong> provides process-centered innovative solutions and services to support the Dallas Water Utilities by leveraging the Utility Management Systems standards, technology and resources to achieve the business objectives of its six (6) core operations (Capital Improvements, Bprovides studies and mapping to both public and private developments to ensure that all development within the floodplain is designed to reduce the risk of flooding.  It prohibits development in areas that are prone to flooding unless all applicable City, State and Federal floodplain related permits are issued.   It encourages the preservation of natural streams and green space and prohibits development in areas that are prone to flood, as required by state law unless an acceptable floodplain permit is issued. By regulating the floodplain and participating in the FEMA Community Rating System program, Dallas property owners located within floodplain areas qualify for a 25% discount on their flood insurance.  Please speak to your insurance agent or FEMA to learn more about the discount and how it might apply to your insurance policy.  Additionally, this division is responsible for the planning and preliminary design of projects that are placed on the needs inventory for future capital program funding.</p>


<p><strong>Flood Control and City-Wide Interior Drainage</strong> Flood protection is the primary service provided by the Flood Control Division, and is provided through the maintenance and operation of the Dallas Floodway Project consisting of pump stations, pressure sewers, levees, flood walls, drainage/closure structures, channels, floodway and miscellaneous facilities.  Maintenance of the Dallas Floodway System must be performed in accordance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulations.  Other duties include maintenance of Flooded Roadway Warning System (FRWS), flood gauge sites, and retention/detention basins.  Additional duties include removal of blockages on City-owned creeks/channels (except creeks and channels located in Parks), storm sewers, and responds to inclement weather emergencies such as snow/ice, wind storms and street flooding.</p>

<p>DWU&rsquo;s management systems is known as the Utility Management System (UMS), see clarifications below.</p>


<!--Document General Information-->



<p><font color="#800000"><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></font>: ("primary clauses" outlined in the supporting documents related to the illustration shown above are included in each page as appropriate)</p>


<ul>
<li>Control of production and service provision (7.5.1 in ISO 9001) is facilitated by Department and Division level procedures, work instructions, and/or forms, accessible through the Division sections included in the illustration shown above.</li>

<ul>
<li>Product (service) Identification, Status, & Traceability (7.5.3 in ISO 9001)</li>

<ul>
<li>Identification - Being able to tell "what" an item or activity is.  For the most part this is driven by the information included on the item (meter, pump, motor, etc.) or by the location of a specific process or asset.  When this is not the case, Identification is referenced in applicable procedures, or work instructions.</li>
<li>Status - The "state of existence" or status may be included in a project list or schedule, but may also be in Division specific databases, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), work order system, work log, or timesheet.  When service requests are involved, the status as it relates to service level agreements may be included in CRMS, SAP, or Division specific controls.</li>
<li>Traceability - Being able to tell where something came from and where it went, is facilitated by SAP, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), SCADA, and/or in localized instructions.</li>
</ul>

<li>Preservation (7.5.5 in ISO 9001) - Addressed as part of procedures or work instructions as applicable.  Examples of each type of preservation is as follows:</li> 

<ul>
<li>Identification - Ensuring the integrity of the work is and will be maintained is accomplished by maintaining a work zone, with signage providing the necessary instructions and cautions.  Other identification methods are through asset management, SAP, and GIS.</li>
<li>Handling - For the most part handling is about making sure we have an area that is sufficient to the job at hand and have the necessary tools and equipment at the site to make sure we are doing the job right.  Assets are acquired and handled according to industry specifications and manufactures recommendations.</li>
<li>Packaging - In DWU, packaging tends to mean treatment, distribution, and collection.  This is accomplished by making sure assets meet specifications and conveyance of the product/services meet standards and requirements.</li> 
<li>Storage - For the most part, storage is based on the applicable asset, source, and environment.  Where there is a need to provide further detail of the controls related to storage, those details are included in the applicable procedures and work instructions.</li>
<li>Protection – Assets and product / services are often protected according to specification and requirements.  Many of the assets are protected in ground (such as a pipeline) or security fence, guard, or data encryptions.  In any case, conditions requiring preservation are addressed in the applicable procedures and work instructions as appropriate.</li>
</ul>

</ul>


<li>Dealing With Customer Property (7.5.4 in ISO 9001) - Customer property (items the customer maintains ownership of even when in our possession) is found throughout DWU.  The controls related to this type of "customer-owned property" are included applicable procedures and work instructions as appropriate.  In any of the scenarios described in this section, the controls include methods to:</li>

<ul>
<li>Identify these items as customer property.</li>
<li>Verify the condition and/or accuracy/authenticity of the items, including situations where the item is lost, damaged, or unsuitable for use (may have been caused by DWU personnel or arrived in the questionable condition).</li>
<li>Protect the item(s) involved through effective handling, packaging, and/or storage methods, as appropriate.</li>
<li>Safeguard the item(s) involved through secured areas or controlled environments, as appropriate.</li>
<li>Report and record issues where customer-owned property is lost, damaged, or unsuitable for use (may have been realized when we came into contact with the customer property or DWU personnel were responsible for the condition) to the customer trough a claims or notification process.</li>
</ul>

<li>Purchasing Activities, Including Control Of Outsourced Processes (4.1, 7.4, & 8.4d) - While <a href="http://www.cod/Directives/pdf/Ad4-05.pdf">Administrative Directive 4-5</a> is the governing document for the City of Dallas, the processes described in the <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-012Purchasing.htm">Purchasing</a> procedure) facilitates the purchasing activities (evaluation/selection of suppliers, details to be included in purchasing documents, receipt of purchased items or services, and analysis/re-evaluation of supplier performance) in support of AD4-5.  Control of outsourced processes at  DWU are for the most part included in applicable procedures and work instructions (i.e., those involving contracts are managed through and re-evaluated through those contracts [see the activities described in <a href="ManagementSystemDocuments/DWU-MSD-041.htm">Capital Services</a>].  When the outsourced process involves another City department (e.g., EBS providing housekeeping and facility/vehicle maintenance services, etc.), these controls are defined in and managed by Departmental agreements as established by City policies.  Re-evaluation of these "other departments" is for the most part passive, meaning we only keep track of issues identified, and are noted on the <a href="Forms/DWU-FRM-004_OpportunitiesAndInnovationForm.doc">Opportunity &amp; Innovation</a> form (DWU-FRM-004) and submitted to the <a href="http://cod/dwu/ISO/ManagementSystemDocuments/DWU-MSD-004-AS.htm">EAC</a>, when situations arise.  The <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-012Purchasing.htm">Purchasing</a> procedure includes methods for receiving, inspection (7.4.3 & 8.2.4), and dealing with nonconforming purchased products or services (8.3).  Each DWU Division or Business Unit address activities related to product realization (7.1) by effectively preparing the item / service for use.</li>
<li>Customer-Related Processes (5.2 & 7.2) - Customer transactions are addressed in procedures and work instructions as appropriate.  Where these situations are realized, the applicable procedure(s) or work instruction(s) includes:</li> 

<ul>
<li>How these requirements are defined,</li>
<li>An assessment of DWU's ability to meet the need identified,</li>
<li>Resolution of any issues DWU needs to ensure its abilities can and will satisfy the defined requirements, and</li>
<li>Records to show DWU's decision to accept the opportunity, including any actions arising from this review.</li>
</ul>

In some cases, product realization activities (defining product objectives, establishing necessary processes or providing resources, defining monitoring/measurement activities, etc.) are included in the applicable work instruction to ensure the product or service involved will meet the need at hand.  


<li>Resource Management activities (6.3, 6.4, 7.5.1c, & 7.6) are for the most part described in the Additional Management System Considerations section shown below.  Limited details related to:</li>

<ul>
<li>Responsibility, authority, and training/competence (5.5.1 & 6.2) may be included in procedures or work instructions where localized controls have been established.</li> 
<li>Maintenance activities related to assets (6.3, 6.4, & 7.5.1c) may be outsourced to other City departments or are managed internally through preventative and corrective maintenance. </li>
<li>The maintenance of monitoring and measuring equipment (verified or calibrated against a standard 7.6) is controlled as defined in <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-006Calibration.htm"> Maintaining Monitoring &amp; Measurement Devices (calibration)</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>

</p>




<!--Document Additional Management System Considerations-->

<p><font color="#800000"><strong>ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS</strong></font>(mainly a concern for the Management Representative(s) and person(s) responsible for document control, this section makes sure we have considered/dealt with applicable department specific issues or points to the actual procedure, process, or document we are to be using).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exclusions (1.2 &amp; 4.2.2a) &ndash;      There are no exclusions for DWU </li>
  <li>Design (7.3) - Activities related to DWU involve design or development activities as outlined in ISO 9001.  These may be outsourced or completed in-house.  For design activities conducted in-house, these will be addressed by applicable procedure(s) or work instruction(s).</li>
  <li>Validation of Processes (7.5.2) - All of the processes performed at DWU can be and are verified, so there are no special processes requiring validation. &nbsp;</li>
  <li class="Arial">Document Control (4.2.3) - See <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-001%20Document-RecordsProcedure-051717.htm">Document &amp; Records Control</a>.</li>
  <li>Records Control (4.2.4) - See <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-001%20Document-RecordsProcedure-051717.htm">Document &amp; Records Control</a>.</li>
  <li>Management System Briefings/Communication, Policies, &amp; Objectives </li>
  <ul>
    <li>ISO 9001 Awareness (6.2.2d)</li>
    <li>ISO 14001</li>
    <li>OHSAS 18001</li>
    <li>Policy (5.3d communicated and understood) - While many of the decisions made are based on the training or education each employee receives, the ability to make good decisions is based on the City of Dallas <a href="https://dallastxgov.sharepoint.com/sites/city/4eval/SitePages/Quality-Management-Policy.aspx">Quality</a>, <a href="https://dallastxgov.sharepoint.com/sites/city/4eval/Shared%20Documents/Environmental%20Policy%2003-21-18.pdf">Environmental</a>, and <a href="https://dallastxgov.sharepoint.com/sites/city/4eval/Shared%20Documents/COD-OHS%20English-042817.pdf">Occupational Health and Safety</a> policies.&nbsp; </li>
    <li class="Arial">Objectives (5.4.1 & 6.2.2d aware of the objectives and how they contribute to the fulfillment of those objectives) - The foundation for determining if the decisions made (based on the policies) were and will continue to be sound is what Quality, Environmental, and Occupational Health and Safety objectives are all about.  These objectives have either a goal to be sustained or a target to be achieved.  Ensuring all employees understand the objectives, targets, and goals that relate to their jobs (i.e. how each employee helps the City fulfill the goals and targets they impact) is how the City of Dallas knows whether the decisions made are sound.</li>
    <li>Communication (5.1a and 5.5.3) - Ensuring, at a minimum, communication methods address </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The importance of meeting customer and statutory/legal product conformity requirements (5.1a).</li>
      <li>The effectiveness of the Utility Management System (QMS 5.5.3).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>


  <li>Management Representative (5.5.2) – Quality and Environmental Management Representative for the City of Dallas is a member of the Management Services Department. Occupational Health & Safety Management Representative for the City of Dallas is a member of the Office of Risk Management.  DWU has a Utility Management Representative in support of the City management representatives, with the following responsibility/authority:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensuring the processes needed for the DWU&rsquo;s portion of the utility management system (UMS) are established, implemented, and maintained.</li>
    <li>Reporting to the DWU Executive Team (Director and Assistant Directors) on the performance of the UMS and any need for improvement.</li>
    <li>Ensuring the promotion of customer requirements, reduced environmental impact, and increased health & safety throughout the organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Management Review (9.3 in ISO 9001) - The  <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-009ManagementReview.htm">Management Review</a> process serves as a guideline for management review activities.  While the <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-009ManagementReview.htm">Management Review</a> process describes quarterly reviews, DWU utilizes a progressive approach, involving executive steering committee meetings every other month, <a href="http://www.cod/dwu/CoreTeamMeetings.html">quarterly managers’ meetings </a>, and <a href="http://www.cod/dwu/WhatsYourLegacy_ISO-Integration.html">quarterly divisional management reviews</a> (each division must conduct and report on an independent, quarterly management review), leading to an overall annual review.  In essence, these bi-monthly and quarterly meetings and divisional management reviews address inputs, as available or appropriate at the time of the meetings or reviews, related to management review inputs (i.e. audit results, customer feedback, process performance/product or service conformity data, CA/PA status, follow-up from previous meetings, operational or organizational changes that could affect the management system, and any recommendations for improvement) while working towards the annual review where this information is compiled and an overall conclusion regarding the suitability (the degree to which the system, policy, and objectives fit DWU), adequacy (the degree to which the system, policy and objectives address all of the requirements DWU has to live up to), and effectiveness (the degree to which the management system, policy and objectives are driving the behavior of DWU) of the management system, policies and objectives.  The results of these monthly and quarterly meetings and reviews, and any actions arising from these meetings and reviews are maintained as part of the management review record (i.e., the record is the progressive result leading to the completion of the management review form used by the City of Dallas [see the <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-009ManagementReview.htm">Management Review</a> process]) with this record maintained as established by the DWU Management Representative.</li>
  <li>UMS communication of management system (EMS, QMS, and OHS) information and requirements is done to all managers and their core team representatives, who then communicate to their staff. </li>
  <li>Training, Responsibility, &amp; Authority (5.3 &amp; 7.2 in ISO 9001) - See the <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-005Training.htm">Training</a> procedure for an overview.  Actual training records are for the most part managed by each Division.</li>
  <li>Product Realization/Management System Planning (5.4.2 &amp; 7.1 in ISO 9001) - See <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-010PlanningForSuccess.htm">Planning For Success</a>.&nbsp; Resource Management (7.1, 7.1.3 &amp; 7.1.4 in ISO 9001) are handled as part of planning (see <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-010PlanningForSuccess.htm">Planning For Success</a>), <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-005Training.htm">Training</a>, and/or through management review activities (as described above).</li>
  <li>Maintenance (7.1.3, 7.1.4, and 7.1.5 in ISO 9001) - The <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-008Maintenance.htm">Maintenance</a> process describes both corrective (repairing equipment after it breaks down) and preventive (scheduled event to keep equipment from breaking down) maintenance activities.  Maintenance activities are conducted in-house or outsourced, with the necessary controls defined in <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-012Purchasing.htm">Purchasing</a>, where the service is purchased.  When the service involves another department (e.g., EBS, CIS, etc.) methods used to monitor and coordinate these activities is facilitated through Inter-Departmental agreements and policies.</li>
  <li>Customer Satisfaction/Feedback and Focus (5.1.2, 8.2, & 9.1.2 in ISO 9001) - Customer complaints are facilitated locally by DWU Divisions.  The method for obtaining data related to customer satisfaction is through Citizen Survey managed and coordinated by Strategic Customer Services.  This information is analyzed (used) as part of the utility management review process to determine if the management system is effectively implemented and to determine if opportunities for improvement can be realized.  In any case, the methods described here and supported by the <a href="ManagementSystemDocuments/DWU-MSD-130.htm">Customer Feedback</a> process help management ensure the organization is focused on the meeting customer requirements.</li>
  <li>Internal Audits (9.2 in ISO 9001) - As defined in the <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-Auditing.htm">audit process</a>.</li>
  <li>Monitoring &amp; Measurement of Processes (9.1.1 in ISO 9001): </li>
  
<ul>
    <li>Process monitoring is accomplished through <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-Auditing.htm">internal audits</a>, a review of data related to the process (see objectives described above), and by sampling of work sites by management (supervisors, managers, etc.).  If there is a need for action, correction (fixing the immediate problem and moving on) takes place immediately (when needed) and corrective or preventive action occurs when the situation suggests the need for a solution beyond a simple fix (see <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-004Improvement.htm">Improvement Systems</a>). </li>
    <li>Product/Service Monitoring - Performance measures are monitored through PerformanceSoft, feedback during staff meetings, monthly and semi-annual status reports, and budgeting for outcomes with actionable items identified and monitored as appropriate.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Nonconformance Control (8.7 & 10.2 in ISO 9001) - As defined in <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-003NonconformanceControl.htm">Control of Nonconforming Product or Service</a>, unless localized controls have been defined.</li>
  <li>Corrective/Preventive Action and any other Improvement Opportunity (10 in ISO 9001) - As defined <a href="http://www.4eval.com/Dallas/COD-Procedures/COD-PRO-004Improvement.htm">Improvement Systems</a>.  </li>
